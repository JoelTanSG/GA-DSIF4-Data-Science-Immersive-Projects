still_live,0,False,Shopee is one of the largest online shopping website in Malaysia and as a user and a consumer myself i really enjoyed the app However the only flaw i find from Shopee is the reviews for the products sold by sellers There are many products available from shopee some has over 10k sales and 1k reviews with 5 star ratings Seeing the product with such a positive rating and so many sales makes you want to buy right Now kita sabar dulu la Relax Sometimes have to compare two different products and do some research before purchase which is what I usually do This is where the start of the problem begins for me personally the reviews Sometimes they are helpful but most times it is not Some people keep writing item arrived safely or barang cun but never say how good is the product That is for a lot of the products that has only like 10 reviews For products with over 1k reviews you still can find a lot of really helpful reviews Okay maybe there are items that you don t need to see the reviews if you know what you are buying but for consumers that has little knowledge on which item to buy reviews are vital for us to make a decisive choice Reviews like Barang sampai or fungsi baik je is not helpful We want to know if the product is good or not Another thing about the reviews is that the 5 stars are mostly praising the sellers SELLER MANTAP or TERBAIK BOS is not a review it s licking the seller s shoe Then there are reviews which I cannot explain with words but only show the pictures for you to understand my frustration If you are a shopee user and you want to leave a review please don t be like these people Give other consumers a proper review,Shopee reviews are stupid,0,malaysia

still_live,0,False,TLDR what to do and what laws applies for noisy neighbor that chit chat laughing loudly during 2 4am and always blast music with their loud stereo Apartment Before you roast me with nak senyap duduk hutan In my over 10 years living in apartment and witnessing so many strange stuffs this is by far the worst kind of neighbor you can ask for Or at least for me I ve dealt with retards that stomps instead of walking during night time and I just ignored them no problem and this time is by far the worst neighbor I ve encountered I can even tolerate construction works hammering down walls from directly under me that wake me up for few weeks but because neighbor actually gave notice and we are all being respectful and understanding I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THESE ISSUES This time some bunch of retards simply just being a nuisance at this point Playing loud music screamo 2 3 of them actually screams like they are in a karaoke room and chit chat laughing loud at 3am is really too far And oh yes I ve talked and scolded them they are still the same I ve dealt with kids jumping around moving furniture at night random knocking noise at night and I just ignore them because these are not permanent and there is no point making a fuss over something that is so temporary But this time I had enough i need help and advice It s actually messing with my mental health And oh if they do all the above during day time I can still tolerate just ignore them and be on my way no problem BUT IT S FUCKING NIGHT TIME AND 3AM 3 FUCKIN AM like for everyday my dudddee How loud was it their room is roughly 7 feet opposite of mine And when they make noise it felt like they are inside my room even if I shut my windows Morning I was woke up by them screaming at music night time can t sleep because they can t shut their fucking mouth My only peace was during around 1pm 6pm I can t give you short context since there are many things that leads to this step So if you wanted to help or interested please read the essay below And thank you for being understanding and patience Hi monyets need serious help and advice I assume the neighbor next door are Indons but I never address their race or anything Been respectful this whole time and I think it s time to really ask for legal parties to take actions They really went too far one night around 9 or 10 pm when they scream like they are inside a karaoke room that time I pretend to take their picture with flashlight on and they noticed one run away and one talked to me asked whats wrong I just tell him senyap sikit boleh They went quiet for a while and shit continues again I don t think they realize how impactful they are to other residents Last night they were laughing loud and chit chat around 3am they done this so many times and I really can t tolerate it anymore I shouted at them tell them to shut up and look at the time they went quiet a while and shit continues So many morning sometimes 9 sometimes 10 I m a freelancer I woke up by one of them screaming to music with the loud ass bass stereo and now WFH really make things worst I ve lost my tolerance last night was my last straw I ve ask people and they usually says like report polis or if this case if assume they are indon neighbor then report to some badan immigrants This few weeks my mental was really impacted a lot by them I m at a point where I have to constant worry about when they are going to fucking act like clowns again I don t want to be like this either but it s difficult to share my views without actually being in my place So I understand some might sees me as a sensitive person I don t mind For next steps I will record evidence of them being a nuisance and if I really have no choice I just try to report to any parties I can find And also try to ask the houses above below and besides them whether they are affected by these clowns just to solidify I m not the one who are being an asshole Also find out who are their landlord so I can communicate abit at this point there is no hope in talking them clowns anymore And also trying to be as civil as possible wondering if there are any legit laws that I can use against them Talked and scolded them and they don t even change a bit I had enough It s almost a month amp x200B If you read it this far thank you I don t do this often unless I really need advice or help And also I know some if not most of you here are actually nice human beings that might share some useful insights Thank you again consider this also a rant from me to release some stress,Noisy apartment neighbor what LEGAL ACTIONS can I take And any laws that I can apply,0,malaysia

answered years later by a Koko and May comic issued in around 2019 to 2021 where Koko s mum was seen digging out Koko s earwax with the exact same stick Now the question arises where this instance was never heard of in Europe or America No one from the west side of the world even Afro Americans who share a similar parenting style with us ever talks about it online This is a matter of personal

still_live,0,False,Just my opinion and things that I have observed In this context I am only talking about students who attend national secondary school because that is my experience there is also the whole ordeal with the UAE examinations that apparently the whole world recognized but Malaysia but its no my focus today 1 Language Barrier I know that Malay is the national language and I do think students need to at least master the Malay language but there is literally no point to teach math and science in Malay or any other language other than English for that matter You see when you move onto Uni they teach everything in English which makes learning Math and Science in Malay quite pointless For non Malay students learning in another language is really hard especially since there are a lot of subject specific terms that are hard to understand 2 Subjects manipulation this is just a theory but I do think the MOE deliberately manipulate the subjects in examinations by changing the contents setting the bench mark and overall making it harder to score on some subjects and easier to score on some others First the mandatory pass for Sejarah I wholeheartedly believe Sejarah is created to not let non Malay students get the SPM certificate ever wonder why it is a mandatory pass The content is largely Malaysia focused and has A LOT of Islamic topics which is easier for Malay students and harder for non Malay students to learn because there is a lot of unfamiliar topics my friends literally told me that they have learnt those topics in PI and sekolah agama before Secondly some subjects are easier to score than others mainly because those are subjects most Malay students are weak in i e math and English Math modern is just a joke at this point since it is so easy and English they literally watered down the syllabus to the point it is equivalent to primary school level in other countries On the other hand some subjects such as Moral Chinese and Malay are notoriously hard to score My qualms is with Moral the scoring baseline has not changed in the last 20 years you still need 90 to get an A on Moral even when you only need 60 to get the same grade on Add Math 3 Hard to get opportunity There are 2 types of post SPM non bumi students one you get 10A and get into Matrikulasi good Asasi programs are Bumi only btw or get a scholarsip if you are really lucky or you are the rest who can all go to STPM which is hard to score well takes 2 years stressful not prioritized when applying to Gov Uni and are less funded While bumi students have so many options no matter how they score This is really unfair to non bumi students since you know you reward the people who did the best If you are poor and a non bumi in Malaysia you might as well not exist because the Gov can t see you Something extra word on the street is the non bumi intake for matriks has been secretly reduced to less than 10 since there is no one to monitor the administration there are a surge of qualified non bumi students who did not get in not talking about the general qualification for Malay students but the secret qualification for non bumi students which is all As Just a rumour don t quote me In conclusion Non bumi students have to work way harder since its literally an uphill battle with the system and settle for less and people wonder why less and less non malay students want to enroll in national schools,How the educational system works against non Malay students,0,malaysia

still_live,0,False,First of all I m no scholar not an expert in religion study subjectively and personally I think religion is a flaw in humanity it stops humans from naturally and truly achieving their free mind beyond the universe and eternal with their own set of religious mindset thinking and faith with their verse that s already difficult to understand and confusing then translate to a lot of other languages which results in possible mislead While of course as much as I only believe in the morality and value of humanity how mother nature wants humans to have I m not hating religious people I would defend freedom of thought and belief to death I learn from different religions I like how Christianity teach forgiveness towards anyone even though it s to your enemy I like how Islam teaches gratitude appreciation for and to return kindness I like how Buddhism teach suffering the cause and the end of it Today subject women rights in the Islam world Which I m here to ask for viewpoint and learn not to hate or anything While reading you might start to do some comparisons like oh the other religion also do this and that why don t you question that Because I m here just to compare the actual practices of Islam people and their beliefs I m learning if what they believe is contradict what they practice that s that I have read lots of stories theories scholarly articles facts etc that in Islam women and men are treated equally and fair there are a lot of bad things outside the Islam world are considered a sin too in the Islam world Basically by simply just listen to their scholar and even reading a bit of the Quran myself I can simply conclude that Islam is just like how people from the outside of the Islam world hold their moral principle value and ethics That s to say people who believe in Islam is pretty much act and think the same like how other people do However when I look at the actual practice in some of the Islamic societies most of the time the result is contradicting what I thought they believe From what I see women are pretty much oppressed in the Islam culture to a certain degree and the thing is due to their belief they don t see anything wrong Isn t Islam telling that men and women are spiritually equal However sexism discrimination and misogyny towards women are common in lots of Islamic societies they can t get their own choice and freedom on a lot of things even though when they got it they got treated badly Women get punished harder than men by just doing simple stuff I have heard people explain that the root of misogyny towards women in Islamic societies is not Islam if that s so why the practices are so much different to their Islamic beliefs Islam telling that a relationship should be one of mutual love respect and kindness While domestic violence is very common in Islamic societies sometimes even women of them would say that s the way of their belief husbands are allowed to punish their wives in an abusive way I mean I subjectively and personally don t think some of the sins that Islamic women commit would deserve a fist and beat punishment like just simply talking with other men or posting a video of themselves on the internet Patriarchy is still oppressed Islam women in a large way it s really rare to see a large population of women in Islamic societies get the opportunity in the limit of universal moral values to do what they want what they like surpass anything they aim for and become anyone they can dream of in Islamic societies While I also learned that forcing coercion and violence is definitely against Islam and not what Muhammad wants however for me the practices of Islam men towards women doesn t look just to what their beliefs Considering how large Islam is you can see more liberal minded Islamic societies in some countries but in some other countries especially the Islamic states that s would be a different scenery I totally understand that what affects religion is not just the belief but also law religious law culture environment demographic country etc Personally this is where I would say that s what religion is about one belief but with a lot of confusion complication misleading verses that contradicted practices that are different But that will lead to another subject if every people in a religion has the same belief why the religion law and their people practices are still so much different around the world From my first paragraph I definitely know there is no simple answer to these questions but still I m just here seeking your viewpoint no hate if I said something wrong correct me,Religion and women rights in the Islam world,0,malaysia

still_live,1,False,TLDR Probably fake microinfluencer 7 5k followers is possibly scamming people by asking them to buy crypto and send to her account Not sure if she is a mule or not but I have strong confidence innocent people are getting scammed out of their money The reason i am confident is that even though she is showing that she is getting money there is no proof on the blockchain that she has sent any money out Only received She has a friend who supposedly first doubled her money Then turned 450 in 4500 Then deposited 1k Then deposited 2k to get 20k within 24 hours However there is NO PROOF of this on the blockchain The only proof she has is a screenshot which i m certain is badly cropped and fake I ll probably get blocked by her soon but till then I ll post updates She has already privated her account and I m thinking she ll delete it soon I was planning to string her on a while more to get more info about her accounts etc but the number of people falling for this is saddening so I hope this message goes out to them Please help spread the news and keep your friends alert I haven t been scammed yet since I didn t send any bitcoin so I can t lodge a police report However if you have friends who have please DO REPORT IT Do we have any recourse against possible scammers Worst comes to worst please report the account https instagram com av drey https instagram com av drey utm medium copy link and possible accomplice https instagram com xminnx https instagram com xminnx utm medium copy link Stay Safe amp x200B Long Version with Pics and Proof So I came across this influencer not very active but has significant and impressionable following who may be scamming people Her following includes some other influencers I say may because her tactics are like all the scammers but I haven t given any money to lose yet so maybe she s saying the truth You judge and say Instagram profile of av drey https preview redd it nbu7fw9qc6j81 jpg width 720 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 5f05e28482f3b602ced539cb71deb0c394aca3d3 Disclaimer I m not convinced she s a real person The last post was 2020 and only thing she has posted recently is this possible scam Then again gen z be like that She posted stories saying guaranteed bitcoin and showing proof that she s withdrawing 1000 everyday with no effort Most people would sense something is wrong and leave but i wanted to see whether it was a scam Screesnshot of her stories inclduing xminnx Testimonial Had to combine 2 to fit reddit s limit https preview redd it d0t617hjr6j81 jpg width 1920 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 30abcd3b458b07e72517610969f1c8eadc39e71a She also had a testimonial from someone I dont know who this person is but looks legit A bit sus though as will see later This Testimonial friend Minyi is going to be important later Anyway moving on i messaged her and she asked me to download the bitcoin com app and register I have the screenshot but due to reddit s limit couldnt post the text

wrong address you have lost your crypto forever That s how many scammers work they ask you to send to them and promise to return more but then they dont She asked that instead of topping up my own wallet I top up someone else s one https preview redd it p0d83dyte6j81 jpg width 720 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 5139a5f02fa3f9ca17e3fdf5f17a09677365da79 Ironically this makes it less suspicious because this is a financial crime due to the bank sending the money to the wallet rather than having it be sent through another crypto account And people wouldn t be dumb enough to do that right amp x200B Anyway when she noticed i was buying 30 dollars only she asked me to do more https preview redd it xlp8a338f6j81 jpg width 720 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s e1a0c9540c09cc10ab4241b2134f5d051c8686a2 Common scam tactic because if it was not a scam why not let me experiment with a bit first and then send more Anyway her justifications were vague so it didn t assure me at all But i can see it may have assured other less suspicious people authority bias https preview redd it ddpyvumef6j81 jpg width 720 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s

so many people cannot keep track Or multiple people scamming using 1 account Both suck She gave me her wallet address One of the great things about btc or crypto is that you can actually see the transactions in and out of a wallet You can use a website like blockchain com Link to her account https www blockchain com btc address bc1qculp6qgk3h92ml2xafugzva5qj6qe4gmjcthyt https www blockchain

Update as of posting this 3 more people were possibly conned As you can see the net amount in the wallet is positive meaning it has received more than it has given out So do you remember this lady who supposedly got 4 5 k and then deposited a further 1k Which wallet is she dealing with No record of 4 5k going out I think that means she is an accomplice Anyway the last time this wallet sent money out was last week But our micro influencer says she s getting everyday Which wallet is sending to her I m 99 convinced it s a scam And more people are falling for it every hour amp x200B She posted

something Basically I had messaged the testimonial friend Minyi about whether this was legit The purpose was to see if they re part of the possible scam together or not These were her responses that I

still_live,0,False,As the title says I am an American coming to ask this question because I have some interests in Singapore but know nothing about it Firstly i am interested in its government and the way it works I believe from what i have been told that the Singaporean government is a dictatorship but other parties and elections are allowed and do happen I also think that despite this there is a large support for the main party in power Are these things true More importantly how do you guys feel perceive the government there Are they effective reliable and good at what they do Or are they more corrupt authoritarian ineffective and overreaching I dont expect them to be only one or the other but i want to know how they are generally Secondly how free do you consider yourself to be in Singapore I wouldnt say the people there are as free as in other democratic countries but how big of an issue is this to people there And just how much are any freedoms restricted Do you have to worry about the government at all whether that be because of them passing more restrictive laws or because of any possible censorship Now more onto the country itself what is the standard of living like there More specifically how well off are people there how good is the economy etc Also how rural urban is the country as a whole Are there any parts of the country you would consider to be poor or bad areas or is most of the country overall good Also what is the culture like there What are the people like and how is society structured there Lastly would you ever leave the country if you could and why or why not And do you think it would be a good decision for me as an American to ever possibly move there Sorry if this was a lot to ask but a big thanks to anyone who took the time to read it and or respond as well,I am an American interested in what Singaporeans think of their country and what it is like,0,singapore

still_live,0,False,Copy and paste from FB Loh Kean Yew Lee Chong Wei and Lin Dan are role models Last December Loh Kean Yew made history as the first Singaporean to win a Badminton World Federation BWF World Championships title The 24 year old pulled off major upsets and stunned the sporting community by beating world number one Viktor Axelsen and world number three Anders Antonsen before besting world number 14 Kidambi Srikanth in the finals to clinch the gold A lesser player might have caved in the face of that pressure but Loh was unfazed in fact he relishes going up against the world s best and brightest I like to play as an underdog he says The pressure is on them I m just going in to enjoy the game and challenge myself When I play with them I hope to see how far I am from them what I can improve on and what I can learn from them With his historic win Loh s days as an underdog might well be over but Loh is not one to rest on his laurels In his mind s eye the World Championships win is already in the rear view mirror Loh is the kind of athlete who conquers one peak and immediately has his sights set on the next one Everyone views success differently When I achieve one goal I d set another goal even higher I actually want to forget about being the world champion he shares adding with a laugh that he s totally not used to people coming up to me and saying Hey world champion More importantly Loh has already moved on to his next goal Dwelling on one win is not what I want to do I m working on consistency so one win is not really a thing Of course nobody can peak all the time or win all the time That s why people like Lee Chong Wei and Lin Dan are such role models because they win almost all the time I won t call myself really good until I become consistent at the top Loh has displayed this drive and determination from a young age having left his family and home in Penang Malaysia at just 13 to enrol in the Singapore Sports School Later bucking societal conventions and parental expectations he made the decision to quit his tertiary studies to focus on badminton full time Many people told me that I should continue with my education as a backup plan Even my parents were scared for me he shares But I can get a certificate any time There s a time limit to sports and a shorter lifespan so if you miss it you miss it For a while Loh tried juggling his education and his passion for badminton but he found it difficult to focus on both I knew I needed to choose one because if I were to continue listening to my parents and doing things by halves in the end if I don t succeed I would blame someone I d rather take full responsibility for my actions and if there are any consequences at least it s my decision I just don t want to have any regrets That decision turned out to be pivotal One way I looked at it was When I don t have a backup plan I ll be more hardworking he says Whenever I feel tired or lazy I m like I have nothing to fall back on I need to keep going The destination If things go according to Loh s plans Olympic glory and a spot atop the world rankings with his loss at the recent India Open finals but a learning step on that path And while he works his way there Loh is finding purpose in inspiring a younger generation and opening up conversations about the sport When people tell me that I inspire them I used to not know what they mean Honestly I was shocked he admits I m just playing badminton and you re inspired by me But as time goes by and I get more and more of that I realise that I can actually change someone s life in a way to a certain extent Like maybe I can show people that sports is a meaningful thing to pursue instead of just study study study Or maybe I can show them that discipline is a really important part of life that to achieve something you need hard work and perseverance I m happy I achieved something and that more people are now following and talking about badminton I hope to open up the path in some way and that eventually more people will take up sports and there will be more support for it When asked about the group of people who recently rallied to raise funds for him after realising that his World Championships win did not come with a cash prize the amount rings in at 367 528 from generous donors Loh is sanguine not for himself but for what it means to the sporting community It s a great thing not for the monetary aspect of it but for the awareness and support that people have for the sport he says I hope we can be a sporting nation Even though we re so small I don t think it s impossible It s all about that personal hunger With how ravenous he is it is safe to say that great things are in store for Singapore and the world s newest sports star Source Bazaar Singapore Jeffrey Yan Photo Gan Attire LV,Loh Kean Yew s interview with Bazaar Singapore,0,singapore
