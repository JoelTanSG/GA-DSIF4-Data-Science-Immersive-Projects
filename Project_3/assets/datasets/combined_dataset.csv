still_live,0,False,Translated from this article https www orientaldaily com my news mingjia fbclid IwAR0RRLMTs9x5Toa6 djkuWvFO0gWKv BMZ5Yqri920Sd h6TI4zkF3BqJ9k from Oriental Daily Most Malaysian Chinese believed Mandarin is an important language therefore feel texts from various fields like biology physics chemistry information technology etc should transition from English to Mandarin It seems that Mandarin will replace English as the lingua franca of the world It is unsurprising they will subconsciously belittle the importance of Malay and English due to sense of pride from the rise of China and the elevated status of the language It gives rise to rejection towards other languages other than Mandarin The most common example in Malaysia is our national language Bahasa Melayu The Prime Minster s call for all government officials to use the language for oversea events were mocked relentlessly They believed Malay is merely a language for Southeast Asia therefore it s not important to master it instead learning Mandarin would suffice This is a very biased mindset as in reality Mandarin has little to no importance within the context of Malaysian society Despite rise of China in this country the status of the Malay language will not and never will be replaced by Mandarin In this country Malay and English are used for all official documents such as contracts technical documents furthermore both languages are broadly used every technical field hence it will be very difficult for someone to function in this country if both languages are mastered Mandarin is an added value language and not required skill Therefore Mandarin doesn t have much of an importance in the country as the people made to believe Just a lot of Chinese can t get over this fact and with the rise of China in mind belittled the Malay language believing Malay is only usable in Malaysia and it will be useless once they leave the country The harsh reality however a vast majority of them would stay in this land for the rest of their lifetime and how many of them could immigrate out from the country Even they did immigrate they could only go to China or Taiwan for because they are Mandarin speaking countries while the rest of the world still use English Hiding within the Chinese bubble to view the world Their perceived emphasis of Mandarin and the rejection of Malay and English caused them to have a poor command of the languages to the point where they can t rejected read anything other Mandarin text this resulted them to retreat to the Chinese sphere to view the outside world isolating themselves from social viewpoints and opinions from the respective Malay and English spheres The blame on national disunity caused by Chinese educations and schools is the result of the isolation and wall erected Its is not wrong to use Mandarin to learn the outside world it s just only China Hong Kong and Taiwan etc have the most comprehensive and systematic Mandarin writing and media Hence for the most part they viewed the world through the perspective of China and or Taiwan which in the end are just the thought processes from the respective countries Taiwan is often being labelled as secessionist and rebellious due to cross strait relations plus the rise of China caused most Mandarin users to understand and explain world events through the perspective of Rise of China due to the proliferation of Chinese media and text This lack of Malaysian perspective caused heated debates and keyboard war online This situation is not limited to individual social media posts even local Chinese media did the same by copy and pasting news report down even details such as country names etc from China Hong Kong or Taiwan without even proper factchecking the source causing the spread of disinformation and misunderstanding This exposed how the local Chinese media being shackled by China Hong Kong or Taiwan it is a shame that they being tunnel visioned despite all the information in the world are widely accessible They are deeply entranced the belief that Mandarin will be elevated due to the rise of China and local languages such as Malay has little or no importance this is a wrong mindset to have Sure Mandarin has more value now than back in the day but its does not imply that Malay is not important Conversely mastering Malay language is very important if we are going to hope on to the trend as proud citizens of Malaysia because China today doesn t want a foreigner who able to speak Mandarin as well as them rather they wanted a human capital who are multilingual and cross culture mindset Its is pointless for someone to able to speak fluent Mandarin but flunked at reading and understanding an official document in Malay or English Therefore the rising status of Mandarin is not a case of I am good and you are bad it also doesn t mean that other languages are not important after learning and mastering Mandarin Mastering English Malay and Chinese meant exposure to various opinion and perspective and to be more tolerate to people with other cultures rather than getting drunken in the myth of Chinese culture is the best and the China is the greatest One of the basic pre requisites of being a world citizen is to broaden one s horizons,Translated Mandarin is not that important,0,malaysia

still_live,0,False,Hi after a long time I m back for this series this part will be the final part of this warning siren series TLDR version is located below the poster In case if you forgot what this series is about this series is intended to let us monyets here know about the existing warning system that are currently operational in Malaysia because most of the public seems to be unaware of their existence and there is not much article on internet talking about it If you haven t read my previous posts about flood and tsunami warning system yet then click the link below Part Existing Early Warning System in Malaysia for Flood Tsunami and War https www reddit com r malaysia comments rrhajh part existing early warning system in malaysia Part Ever wonder how does Malaysia tsunami warning siren sounds like https www reddit com r malaysia comments s5bu7g part ever wonder how does malaysia tsunami We will be only focusing on siren type warning system in this series Ok if you are not live under the rock then you will surely know about the Russian invasion on Ukraine and their capital s air raid siren blaring non stop in these recent days amp x200B Kyiv Independence Square https preview redd it 3etb9xtf5kl81 jpg width amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 0e624053a9b2af518e83ac67a75b214a28b3d3eb But have you ever wondered about what does our air raid siren sounds like Or does such warning system even exist in Malaysia at all Because we never conducted any nationwide air raid siren test routinely like other countries and I bet most of us also never heard of any story news about our air raid siren being sounded tested Thus many seems to assume that Malaysia do not have any air raid siren in place Well that statement is true to a certain extend Okay let s get straight to the topic Warning system name Public Warning System PWS Sistem Amaran Awam Management agency Angkatan Pertahanan Awam Malaysia APM Malaysia Civil Defence Force One thing should be noted is that in most of the news I found the news report never explicitly said the siren are used for air strike air raid or war but instead they said the siren are used for bencana or disaster which is somehow quite ambiguous Here is what the Civil Defence Force website https www civildefence gov my en blog poster siapsiaga sejarah pws jpam describe about the warning system gt In Malaysia Civil Defence Department MCDD initially used the Public Warning System PWS adopted by the British Among the PWS used are conventional sirens and electric sirens which were installed in economical important areas based such as the ports The operation of these PWS sirens have been entrusted to Malaysia Civil Defence Department MCDD gt gt gt gt Since 1960s PWS have been used as a system for early warning against air raid during wartime In 1970s PWS sirens have been installed in several strategic locations such as government administrative buildings in few states to provide early warning about the possibility of threats and dangers to the public MCDD have used these PWS in Penang during Integrated Air Defence System IADS exercises under Five Power Defence Agreement FPDA With the implementation of Malaysia Air Defence Ground Environment MADGE project in MCDD had installed PWS sirens in Kuala Lumpur and Petaling Jaya which considered as the main administrative and economical sector that have to be protected from any threats of war attack The latest electric PWS sirens have also been installed in several MCDD s beach rescue towers Baywatch since the tsunami in gt gt gt gt Note No video or news report of activation or test of warning siren in above mentioned location KL PJ etc was found on Internet amp x200B Poster of what different tones of siren means Poster from APM website the front is so small

2a1bb302cc95169413d1fff1a933d586b490fbe4 But according to my findings there seems to be three types of sirens Other than the siren that are mounted or attached to a building or tower like the siren in the videos above there are also a mobile type electric siren amp x200B Mobile electric siren https www youtube com watch v cyPEC PUXPQ https www youtube com watch v cyPEC PUXPQ https youtu be D

f0451fc7b8302e891e6a9e466fbf80f3a7fdb233 Another one will be an old school hand crank siren probably no longer in use only as a reserve backup I think https www youtube com shorts tHEY0a97ooY https www youtube com shorts tHEY0a97ooY https preview redd it vcz0zidy7kl81 jpg width amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 9530d9d0ba81d05ce007021758c2f8207f67cbc2 TV1 news report about testing of siren at Kota Kinabalu administrative building but the siren is nowhere to be seen https youtu be cqCdyGA0pPg https youtu be cqCdyGA0pPg However if you watch all of the videos above you will find out a pattern All of the sirens have to be manually activated In the mobile type electric siren you can see they even have to manually turn on and turn off to create the classical WWII siren tone I think the siren in first video are also the same As far as I know there are no remotely controlled siren and those sirens are not linked to a control center You have to manually turn on or turn off the siren The one on the tower https preview redd it 5ro0q61c8kl81 jpg width amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 3b861e62036e8486cfe038b984017ee4e9c52fa7 That s mean if some emergency occur they have to receive a notification from the gov arm forces superior first then the APM personals have to rush to the room with the button to activated it and have to manually create the correct tone which means there might be delays and errors happen during this process While the mobile type sirens are most probably used at certain disaster site like search and rescue operation in a collapsed building If there observe any building movement then they will sound the siren to inform the rescue team to bug out and evacuate to safety For the old school hand crank siren like I mentioned above probably not in use anymore or only serve as a reserve backup the sound range probably can cover a small neighbourhood only Important notes Except the APM website all news report only said the APM warning siren are used for bencana or disaster there is no mention of they are being used for war air raid or missile strike Thus I think it s most probably because Malaysia have been in a state of peace for a long time so they just turn it into a natural disaster warning siren There are no citywide or nationwide warning siren in place these sirens probably only located in certain APM compound or certain police station so there won t be scene of the whole KL blasting out air raid siren during an actual air strike These sirens are not linked to a control center and are independent of each other No news report about nationwide or citywide air raid siren drill was found on Internet those drills in the videos above are all conducted at limited location only mostly in APM compounds or government building amp x200B That s why the air raid siren is nearly non existance to the public and that s also why I said the impression of Malaysia do not have ai raid siren is true to a certain extend You might also ask why it is managed by Civil Defence Force Well the agency itself already have the word Defence in their name That s mean they have a second purpose They are not just a department that have to deal with natural disaster catching snakes and etc but they also have to prepare for enemy attack during war times as described in their website https www civildefence gov my en profil apm maklumat korporat

underground metro station or their basement to take shelter However since Malaysia never has threat of an air attack since World War and not actively involved in Cold War so we basically have no culture of building basement at our home or no incentive for government to construct public bomb shelter So in case Malaysia is somehow drag into a conventional war and there is a threat of air strike

still_live,0,False,Having been out of the country for a while due to COVID I had a long discussion with my Malaysian friends over the state of education in Malaysia And it seems that I have really been disconnected with the situation over here I was educated in the 90s under KBSM and it did not feel like the education quality was particularly bad and SPM was quite a relevant certification that granted me access to top tier universities around the world If I was still based in Malaysia I thought I would be sending my kids to KBSM However it seems that its not really the case anymore Most if not all of my friends no longer believe in the local syllabus and education system despite benefiting from the system years ago They had numerous reasons politically motivated teaching bad teachers outdated syllabus non existent infrastructures etc On the other hand international schools are sprouting like mushrooms everywhere and they seem to be getting more affordable Interestingly some of these schools don t even have a campus but consist of just several shop lot units These friends would now rather pay the hefty fees of more than RM20k per year instead of sending their kids to free government schools And some of these fees can get really ridiculous It can cost more than a university education in an Ivy League I am now wondering what is the general consensus on this matter If you had the financial means would you still consider government schooling for your kids Or would you send them to an international school How far financially are you willing to go to ensure that your kids can attend quality education,Malaysian Education International or Government School,0,malaysia

still_live,0,False,TLDR what to do and what laws applies for noisy neighbor that chit chat laughing loudly during 4am and always blast music with their loud stereo Apartment Before you roast me with nak senyap duduk hutan In my over years living in apartment and witnessing so many strange stuffs this is by far the worst kind of neighbor you can ask for Or at least for me I ve dealt with retards that stomps instead of walking during night time and I just ignored them no problem and this time is by far the worst neighbor I ve encountered I can even tolerate construction works hammering down walls from directly under me that wake me up for few weeks but because neighbor actually gave notice and we are all being respectful and understanding I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THESE ISSUES This time some bunch of retards simply just being a nuisance at this point Playing loud music screamo of them actually screams like they are in a karaoke room and chit chat laughing loud at 3am is really too far And oh yes I ve talked and scolded them they are still the same I ve dealt with kids jumping around moving furniture at night random knocking noise at night and I just ignore them because these are not permanent and there is no point making a fuss over something that is so temporary But this time I had enough i need help and advice It s actually messing with my mental health And oh if they do all the above during day time I can still tolerate just ignore them and be on my way no problem BUT IT S FUCKING NIGHT TIME AND 3AM FUCKIN AM like for everyday my dudddee How loud was it their room is roughly feet opposite of mine And when they make noise it felt like they are inside my room even if I shut my windows Morning I was woke up by them screaming at music night time can t sleep because they can t shut their fucking mouth My only peace was during around 1pm 6pm I can t give you short context since there are many things that leads to this step So if you wanted to help or interested please read the essay below And thank you for being understanding and patience Hi monyets need serious help and advice I assume the neighbor next door are Indons but I never address their race or anything Been respectful this whole time and I think it s time to really ask for legal parties to take actions They really went too far one night around or pm when they scream like they are inside a karaoke room that time I pretend to take their picture with flashlight on and they noticed one run away and one talked to me asked whats wrong I just tell him senyap sikit boleh They went quiet for a while and shit continues again I don t think they realize how impactful they are to other residents Last night they were laughing loud and chit chat around 3am they done this so many times and I really can t tolerate it anymore I shouted at them tell them to shut up and look at the time they went quiet a while and shit continues So many morning sometimes sometimes I m a freelancer I woke up by one of them screaming to music with the loud ass bass stereo and now WFH really make things worst I ve lost my tolerance last night was my last straw I ve ask people and they usually says like report polis or if this case if assume they are indon neighbor then report to some badan immigrants This few weeks my mental was really impacted a lot by them I m at a point where I have to constant worry about when they are going to fucking act like clowns again I don t want to be like this either but it s difficult to share my views without actually being in my place So I understand some might sees me as a sensitive person I don t mind For next steps I will record evidence of them being a nuisance and if I really have no choice I just try to report to any parties I can find And also try to ask the houses above below and besides them whether they are affected by these clowns just to solidify I m not the one who are being an asshole Also find out who are their landlord so I can communicate abit at this point there is no hope in talking them clowns anymore And also trying to be as civil as possible wondering if there are any legit laws that I can use against them Talked and scolded them and they don t even change a bit I had enough It s almost a month amp x200B If you read it this far thank you I don t do this often unless I really need advice or help And also I know some if not most of you here are actually nice human beings that might share some useful insights Thank you again consider this also a rant from me to release some stress,Noisy apartment neighbor what LEGAL ACTIONS can I take And any laws that I can apply,0,malaysia

still_live,1,False,TLDR Probably fake microinfluencer 5k followers is possibly scamming people by asking them to buy crypto and send to her account Not sure if she is a mule or not but I have strong confidence innocent people are getting scammed out of their money The reason i am confident is that even though she is showing that she is getting money there is no proof on the blockchain that she has sent any money out Only received She has a friend who supposedly first doubled her money Then turned in Then deposited 1k Then deposited 2k to get 20k within hours However there is NO PROOF of this on the blockchain The only proof she has is a screenshot which i m certain is badly cropped and fake I ll probably get blocked by her soon but till then I ll post updates She has already privated her account and I m thinking she ll delete it soon I was planning to string her on a while more to get more info about her accounts etc but the number of people falling for this is saddening so I hope this message goes out to them Please help spread the news and keep your friends alert I haven t been scammed yet since I didn t send any bitcoin so I can t lodge a police report However if you have friends who have please DO REPORT IT Do we have any recourse against possible scammers Worst comes to worst please report the account https instagram com av drey https instagram com av drey utm medium copy link and possible accomplice https instagram com xminnx https instagram com xminnx utm medium copy link Stay Safe amp x200B Long Version with Pics and Proof So I came across this influencer not very active but has significant and impressionable following who may be scamming people Her following includes some other influencers I say may because her tactics are like all the scammers but I haven t given any money to lose yet so maybe she s saying the truth You judge and say Instagram profile of av drey https preview redd it nbu7fw9qc6j81 jpg width amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 5f05e28482f3b602ced539cb71deb0c394aca3d3 Disclaimer I m not convinced she s a real person The last post was and only thing she has posted recently is this possible scam Then again gen z be like that She posted stories saying guaranteed bitcoin and showing proof that she s withdrawing everyday with no effort Most people would sense something is wrong and leave but i wanted to see whether it was a scam Screesnshot of her stories inclduing xminnx Testimonial Had to combine to fit reddit s limit https preview redd it d0t617hjr6j81 jpg width amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 30abcd3b458b07e72517610969f1c8eadc39e71a She also had a testimonial from someone I dont know who this person is but looks legit A bit sus though as will see later This Testimonial friend Minyi is going to be important later Anyway moving on i messaged her and she asked me to download the bitcoin com app and register I have the screenshot but due to reddit s limit couldnt post the text where she asks me to register https preview redd it g6gibcgod6j81 jpg width amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 5838440240d0cc9c685b48c0a7e1761a01d4e9ce Asked me to click Buy on BTC https preview redd it

amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 55599c232b5e727ca6ee91e348c276d35c9e189b Now when you buy crypto the amount is sent to a wallet with a unique address Once you send to a wrong address you have lost your crypto forever That s how many scammers work they ask you to send to them and promise to return more but then they dont She asked that instead of topping up my own wallet I top up someone else s one https preview redd it p0d83dyte6j81 jpg width amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 5139a5f02fa3f9ca17e3fdf5f17a09677365da79 Ironically this makes it less suspicious because this is a financial crime due to the bank sending the money to the wallet rather than having it be sent through another crypto account And people wouldn t be dumb enough to do that right amp x200B Anyway when she noticed i was buying dollars only she asked me to do more https preview redd it xlp8a338f6j81 jpg width amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s e1a0c9540c09cc10ab4241b2134f5d051c8686a2 Common scam tactic because

its person scamming so many people cannot keep track Or multiple people scamming using account Both suck She gave me her wallet address One of the great things about btc or crypto is that you can actually see the transactions in and out of a wallet You can use a website like blockchain com Link to her account https www blockchain com btc address bc1qculp6qgk3h92ml2xafugzva5qj6qe4gmjcthyt https

Update as of posting this more people were possibly conned As you can see the net amount in the wallet is positive meaning it has received more than it has given out So do you remember this lady who supposedly got k and then deposited a further 1k Which wallet is she dealing with No record of 5k going out I think that means she is an accomplice Anyway the last time this wallet sent money out was last week But our micro influencer says she s getting everyday Which wallet is sending to her I m convinced it s a scam And more people are falling for it every hour amp x200B She posted this again just a while back https preview redd it 7jaycf26h6j81 jpg width amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s a7e2002f85a0929e1e4d5ab7940180f76fbb9f7c If someone you know may have been potentially scammed by

police immediately unless of course they can show the transactions on the blockchain amp x200B Update Right as I was about to post this one of the lines I d cast caught something Basically I had messaged the testimonial friend Minyi about whether this was legit The purpose was to see if they re part of the possible scam together or not These were her responses that I got just now Supposedly she not only got k yesterday she also got 20k few days back Why she would not put a higher amount if she already got 20k is a mystery https preview redd it vep8qd31o6j81 jpg width amp format pjpg amp

still_live,0,False,So I m getting a job at one of Singapore s big name IT companies Got the job via a recruitment agency Went through the contract yesterday and one of the clauses was this bullshit about liquidated damages To be clear this is different from the month notice clause That s standard This is some extra clause that says if I terminate my contract early I need to pay 1mth salary to the agency Its not my first job with a recruitment agency but its the first time I ve seen this clause Just seems like bullshit I get the idea that you want to discourage job hoppers or whatever but it seems very restrictive There is also some bullshit about not allowed to discuss my contract details and salary which I guess I m breaking by posting this so I m keeping it as vague as possible,Recruitment Agency has a clause seeking m salary if I terminate my contract,0,singapore
